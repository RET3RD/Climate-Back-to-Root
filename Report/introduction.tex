The purpose of this project was to put all the knowledge acquired during the MNXB01 course to use in a all encompassing project covering the work in Linux terminal, working with git and github, implementing functions and classes with C++ as well as finalizing all the work and putting  it in a presentable and easily readable way by using ROOT. In this particular project we gathered weather data from various weather stations all over Sweden that then proceeded to be analyzed in various ways such as the average temperature of each year, deviation from the average temperature, finding the hottest and coldest day of each year and how the latitude influences the temperature in any form.
